\begin{itemize}
	\item{15th October 2015 - V0.0Alpha is released for testing and early case studies}
	\item{15th December 2015 - V0.0Beta is released after the thesis presentation}
\end{itemize}

\section{To Do:}

\begin{itemize}

\item{Check if climate time series are longer than groundwater time series at model setup}
\item{Check if units of the climate data are in the right order of magnitude}
\item{Calculate the water balance of the unsaturated zone and provide a method to check it}
\item{Add probability of exceedence graph}
\item{Transform parameter values back for reporting in plot\_results and plot\_diagnostics}
\item{Choose step at which innovations are taken into account not to on python index but real time value (Does this help on calibration?) }
\item{Make it possible to run without initial parameter estimates (maybe use a global optimization scheme then, and a local (fmin) otherwise?)}
\item{...}
\end{itemize}
