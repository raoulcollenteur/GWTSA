	abstract = {An analytic approach is presented for the simulation of variations in the groundwater level due to temporal variations of recharge in surficial aquifers. Such variations, called groundwater dynamics, are computed through convolution of the response function due to an impulse of recharge with a measured time series of recharge. It is proposed to approximate the impulse response function with an exponential function of time which has two parameters that are functions of space only. These parameters are computed by setting the zeroth and first temporal moments of the approximate impulse response function equal to the corresponding moments of the true impulse response function. The zeroth and first moments are modeled with the analytic element method. The zeroth moment may be modeled with existing analytic elements, while new analytic elements are derived for the modeling of the first moment. Moment matching may be applied in the same fashion with other approximate impulse response functions. It is shown that the proposed approach gives accurate results for a circular island through comparison with an exact solution; both a step recharge function and a measured series of 10 years of recharge were used. The presented approach is specifically useful for modeling groundwater dynamics in aquifers with shallow groundwater tables as is demonstrated in a practical application. The analytic element method is a gridless method that allows for the precise placement of ditches and streams that regulate groundwater levels in such aquifers; heads may be computed analytically at any point and at any time. The presented approach may be extended to simulate the effect of other transient stresses (such as fluctuating surface water levels or pumping rates), and to simulate transient effects in multi-aquifer systems.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive and efficient approach is presented for the calibration of transient groundwater models. The approach starts with the time series analysis of the measured heads in observation wells using all active stresses as input series, which may include rainfall, evaporation, surface water levels, and pumping. The time series analysis results in the impulse response function of each stress at the observation well. For each impulse response function, the temporal moments M0 and M1 may be computed. Both moments fulfill differential equations that are equivalent to the differential equation for steady groundwater flow, with known values along physical boundaries. The model of M0 may be calibrated for the transmissivity, as it does not depend on the storage coefficient; the computed values of M0 at the observation wells are used for calibration. The model of M1 may be calibrated for the storage coefficient, once the transmissivity is known from the M0 model; the computed values of M1 at the observation wells are used for calibration. The approach is intended for systems that may be approximated as linear. In summary, our proposed calibration process for transient models reduces to the calibration of only two steady models. Several examples are given to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {A non-linear state space model is developed for describing groundwater fluctuations. Non-linearity is introduced by modeling the (unobserved) degree of water saturation of the root zone. The non-linear relations are based on physical concepts describing the dependence of both the actual evapotranspiration and the percolation rate on the degree of saturation of the root zone. Precipitation and reference evaporation are the input variables. Recharge from the root zone is transferred through the percolation zone to the water table by means of a linear reservoir model. The flux in the percolation zone is assumed to be independent of the groundwater level. Errors due to model assumptions and parameter uncertainties are modeled as a noise process. The parameters of the resulting stochastic model are calibrated on time series by combining an extended Kalman filter with a maximum-likelihood criterion. The model is tested at two locations and compared with a linear time series model. It is shown that the non-linear model estimated extreme groundwater levels better than the linear time series model. The variance of the stochastic component reduced significantly. This implies that effects from natural influences can be separated from non-natural influences with less uncertainty. Another advantages of the non-linear model is that it also gives an indication of fluctuations in the degree of saturation in the root zone.},

	abstract = {The recharge of a water-table aquifer involves transfer of the infiltration (effective rainfall) through the unsaturated zone. In certain areas the depth at which the water table lies and the properties of the unsaturated zone can vary greatly and thus the determination, as a function of time, of the recharge actually arriving in the saturated aquifer can be rather difficult.

However, we need to know this recharge in order to simulate the true behaviour of the aquifer in transient state in a regional digital model of the aquifer for the purpose of calibration or prediction.

The resolution of the exact flow equations in the unsaturated zone is possible, but seems still to be far too complex for practical applications.

In this paper we first propose a methodology for the identification of the spatial variability of the infiltration transfer function using common climatic and piezometric data. A parametrisation of these transfer functions using gamma distributions as basic functions is then suggested. Two practical examples make it possible to check the applicability of the procedure.},

	abstract = {A common practice for hydrologists to determine the performance of a hydrological model and its parameter values, is by calibrating the model parameters on observed discharge data, but this data is not always available. For this reason, other data should be used as complementary data in order to reduce the uncertainty of outflow and processes in the ungauged basins.

This thesis presents a case study on an area in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, to see whether groundwaterlevel data can be used as complementary data for hydrological models of ungauged basins. It has been divided into two Hydrological Response Units (Lowland and Hillslope) with use of the surface slope and the height above the nearest drainage (HAND) algorithm.

The main result is that a combined addition of groundwater level measurements and constraints did show reduced uncertainty, and thus improvement, of the internal model processes, especially the fluxes towards and out of the slow responding reservoir. Validation of these processes still remains difficult in ungauged areas, but it is believed that valid results can be made on the outflow out of the lowland areas with a combination of constraints and groundwater measurements to determine internal processes, and evaporation estimates obtained from satellite imagery to reduce the uncertainty of the total runoff out of the area.},

	abstract = {A priori determined model structures are common in catchment rainfall-runoff modeling. While this has resulted in many ready-to-use modeling tools, there are several shortcomings of a one-size-fits-all model structure. The uniqueness of catchments with respect to their hydrological behavior and the need to adapt model complexity to data availability challenge this status quo. We present a flexible approach to model development where the model structure is adapted progressively based on catchment characteristics and the data described by the experimentalist. We demonstrate this approach with the Maimai catchment in New Zealand, a location with a large availability of data, including stream discharge, groundwater levels, and stream isotope measurements. Different types of data are introduced progressively, and the architecture of the model is adjusted in a stepwise fashion to better describe the processes suggested by the new data sources. The revised models are developed in a way to strike a balance between model complexity and data availability, by keeping models as simple as possible, but complex enough to explain the dynamics of the data. Our work suggests that (1) discharge data provides information on the dynamics of storage (represented by the “free” water in the reservoirs) subject to pressure wave propagation generated by rainfall into the catchment, (2) groundwater data provides information on thresholds and on the contribution of different portions of the catchment to stream discharge, and (3) isotope data provides information on particle transport and mixing of the rainfall with the storage present in the catchment. Moreover, while groundwater data appear to be correlated with discharge data, and only a marginal improvement could be obtained adding this information to the model development process, isotope data appear to provide an orthogonal view on catchment behavior. This result contributes to understanding the value of data for modeling, which may serve as a guidance in the process of gauging ungauged catchments.},

The situation is more ambiguous in large groundwater bodies located in the eastern part of the country, where the unsaturated zone increases from near zero along the edges to about 40 m in the centre of the area. As depth of the unsaturated zone increases, groundwater level reacts with an increasing delay to fluctuations in climate and influences of human activities. The aim of the present paper is to model groundwater level fluctuations in these areas using a linear stochastic transfer function model, relating groundwater levels to estimated precipitation excess, and to separate artificial components from the natural groundwater regime. In this way, the impact of groundwater withdrawal and the reclamation of a 1000 km2 polder area on the groundwater levels in the adjoining higher ground could be assessed. It became evident that the linearity assumption of the transfer functions becomes a serious drawback in areas with the deepest groundwater levels, because of non-linear processes in the deep unsaturated zone and the non-synchronous arrival of recharge in the saturated zone. Comparison of the results from modelling the influence of reclamation with an analytical solution showed that the lowering of groundwater level is partly compensated by reduced discharge and therefore is less than expected.},

The VIC and TOPMODEL are then obtained from specific constitutive functions and numerical approximations. In general, SPM leads to compact equations in canonical ODE form, making the behavior of the model transparent and facilitating improvements of both the conceptual model itself and its numerical implementation. A comprehensive numerical analysis of SPM, TOPMODEL, and VIC is presented, providing insight into the timescale dependence of their parameters. It is demonstrated that uncontrolled numerical implementations, particularly traditional fixed-step explicit Euler methods, can introduce considerable artifacts into the behavior of conceptual models such as TOPMODEL, corrupting calibration and prediction.},

These problems led to the abandonment of powerful classical analysis methods (Newton-type optimisation, derivative-based uncertainty analysis) and have motivated extensive research into nonsmooth optimisation and even new parameter estimation philosophies (e.g. GLUE). This paper shows that some of these complexities are not inherent features of hydrological models, but are numerical artefacts due to model thresholds and poorly selected time stepping schemes. We present a numerically robust methodology for implementing conceptual models, including rainfall-runoff and snow models, that ensures micro-scale smoothness of objective functions and guarantees macro-scale model stability. The methodology employs robust and unconditionally stable time integration of the models, complemented by careful threshold smoothing. A case study demonstrates the benefits of these techniques.},

	abstract = {Conceptual hydrological modelling has under-utilised classical parameter analysis techniques (for both optimisation and uncertainty assessment) due to the prohibitively complicated nonsmooth geometry of typical parameter distributions. In the companion paper, a numerically robust model implementation framework was developed, based on stable time stepping schemes and careful threshold smoothing to eliminate the roughness of parameter surfaces. Here, this framework is exploited to enable parameter estimation using powerful and well-established techniques including: (i) Newton-type optimisation and (ii) principal-component-type (Hessian-based) uncertainty analysis. A case study using a representative rainfall-runoff-snow model illustrates the advantages of these previously unavailable methods, contrasting them with slower and less informative current approaches designed for nonsmooth functions. In addition to boosting the computational efficiency, the methods advocated in the paper yield more insight into improved model formulation and parameterisation (e.g., reducing model nonlinearity, detecting ill-conditioning and handling parameter multi-optimality). The impact of extreme model nonlinearity on model and parameter stability is also discussed, focusing on model identification aspects.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a nonlinear transfer function noise model for time-series modeling of unconfined groundwater hydrographs. The motivation for its development was that existing groundwater time-series models were unable to simulate large recharge events and multiyear droughts. This was because existing methods do not partition rainfall to runoff and do not account for nonlinear soil water drainage. To account for these nonlinear processes, a vertically integrated soil moisture module was added to an existing transfer function noise model. The soil moisture module has a highly flexible structure that allowed 84 different forms to be built. Application of the time-series model requires numerical calibration of parameters for the transfer functions, noise model and, for the nonlinear models, the soil moisture module. This was undertaken using the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES) global calibration scheme. However, reproducible calibration to the global optima was challenging and a number of modifications were required to the transfer function noise model. In trialing the 84 nonlinear models and 2 linear models, each was applied to eleven observation bores within a paired catchment study area in Great Western, Victoria, Australia. In comparison with existing groundwater hydrograph time-series models, the proposed nonlinear time-series model performed significantly better at all observation bores during calibration and evaluation periods. Both the linear and nonlinear models were also used to quantify the impact of revegetation within the paired catchment; however, results were inconclusive, which is likely due to time-series data for the state of the revegetation being unavailable. By analyzing the application of 84 nonlinear models to each bore, an optimal structure for the soil moisture module was identified. It is unlikely, however, that this model structure would be appropriate for all climates and geologies. To encourage further investigations, open-source code for the highly flexible groundwater time-series modeling framework is available and we invite others to develop new models.},

	abstract = {There is an increasing demand for modelling the fluxes of chemical constituents at the catchment scale. Conceptual runoff models provide a basis for such modelling tasks provided that they capture the essential hydrological processes. However, most conceptual models do not fully address interactions between unsaturated and saturated storage. This can lead to unrealistic simulations for watersheds with shallow groundwater, where a large part of the soil volume can contribute to both the unsaturated and the saturated storage, depending on groundwater levels. Adding a small amount of water to the saturated storage will cause a significant amount of water stored in the unsaturated zone to change its status to ‘saturated’. The maximum volume of the unsaturated storage also decreases with rising groundwater levels, i.e. increasing saturated storage. In this study, a new model concept was proposed in which special emphasis was put on the interaction between saturated and unsaturated storage. The total storage was divided into two compartments, representing saturated and unsaturated storage, with a boundary moving up and down in response to the water budget of the compartments. Groundwater dynamics show a distinct pattern along the hillslope studied. Groundwater levels in an area close to the stream had dynamics similar to runoff, whereas levels further upslope responded to rainfall with a delay. To represent these differences in the model, the hillslope was subdivided into a riparian and an upslope reservoir. The performance of the new model was compared with that of simpler model variants without spatial differentiation and with or without the new formulation allowing for interactions between unsaturated and saturated storage. The new model approach provided the best results for simulating both runoff and groundwater dynamics. The subdivision of the hillslope accounted for most of the performance increase. To test the model structure further, 18O concentrations in the stream were simulated and compared with measured values. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The resulting class of models is referred to as predefined IR function in continuous time (PIRFICT). It provides a useful tool for standardized analysis of time series, as it can be calibrated using irregularly spaced data and does not require a model identification phase prior to calibration. In section 2, the discrete Box-Jenkins (BJ) model is presented and transformed into continuous time to obtain the PIRFICT model. The discrete transfer function of a BJ model, which is made up of a variable number of parameters, is replaced by a simple analytical expression that defines the IR function. From the IR function, block response functions are derived that enable the model to handle irregularly spaced data. In the example application, the parameter estimates and performance of the BJ and PIRFICT model are compared using a data set of 15 piezometers and a simulated series. It was found that the estimated transfer and BR functions of both models follow the same general pattern, although the BJ transfer functions are partly irregular. The performance of both models proves to be highly comparable for all piezometers.},

The basic equations were published earlier by von Asmuth et al. (2002), who used them as part of a continuous time transfer function noise model. It is shown that the methods behind the model are build on two principles: The first is the fact that the equations of a Kalman filter degenerate to a form that is equivalent to “conventional” autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models when the modeled data are considered to be free of measurement errors. This assumption, in comparison to the “full” Kalman filter, also yields a better prediction efficiency (Ahsan and O'Connor, 1994). The second is the mathematical equivalence between discrete time AR parameters and continuous exponentials and the point that continuous time models provide an elegant solution for modeling irregularly spaced observations (e.g., Harvey, 1989). Because simple least squares methods do not apply in case of modeling irregular data, a sum of weighted squared innovations (ΣWΣI) criterion is introduced and derived from the likelihood function of the innovations. In an example application it is shown that the estimates of the ΣWΣI criterion converge to maximum likelihood estimates for larger sample sizes. Finally, we propose to use the so-called innovation variance function as an additional diagnostic check, next to the well-known autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions.},

	abstract = {For visual interpretation, mapping or empirical modelling purposes, the amount of information contained in a full spatio-temporal description of the groundwater table dynamics is simply too large. For such purposes, the data has to be compressed without loosing too much information. Methods have been developed to visualise the groundwater regime in overall graphs, or statistically characterise the dynamics with a limited set of parameters. More recently, methods have been sought to identify the properties that determine the dynamics of a groundwater system. In such approaches, it is believed that the spatial differences in the groundwater dynamics are determined by the system properties, while its temporal variation is driven by the dynamics of the input into the system. In this paper, a method is presented that links the dynamics of the input to the spatially variable system properties, and results in a new set of parameters that characterise the groundwater dynamics (GD). While the dynamics of the input are characterised by its mean level and annual amplitude, the functioning of the groundwater system is characterised by its impulse response (IR) function. The IR function can for instance be estimated empirically using a time series model. Subsequently, the input and system characteristics are combined into a set of parameters that describe the output, or GD, using simple analytical expressions. It is shown that these so-called GD characteristics (the mean depth, convexity, annual amplitude and phase shift), can describe the GD in detail (for as far as the time series model can). In the example application, the GD characteristics are compared to other methods for characterising the groundwater regime, using two example series of groundwater level observations. It is shown that the so-called MxGL statistics (Mean Highest, Lowest or Spring Groundwater Level) that are often used have some important drawbacks, as they filter out the low-frequency dynamics of a system and mix-up annual with higher frequencies. Consequently, it is concluded that the capability of MxGL statistics in characterising the GD at different locations is less than that of GD characteristics.},

In comparison to autoregressive moving average (ARMA) time series models, the PIRFICT model is optimized for use on hydrologic problems. The objective of the paper is twofold. First, an approach is presented for handling multiple stresses in the model. Each stress has a specific parametric impulse response function. Appropriate impulse response functions for other stresses than precipitation are derived from analytical solutions of elementary hydrogeological problems. Furthermore, different stresses do not need to be connected in parallel in the model, as is the standard procedure in ARMA models. Second, general procedures are presented for modeling and interpretation of the results. The multiple-input PIRFICT model is applied to two real cases. In the first one, it is shown that this model can effectively decompose series of ground water head fluctuations into partial series, each representing the influence of an individual stress. The second application handles multiple observation wells. It is shown that elementary physical knowledge and the spatial coherence in the results of multiple wells in an area may be used to interpret and check the plausibility of the results. The methods presented can be used regardless of the hydrogeological setting. They are implemented in a computer package named Menyanthes (www.menyanthes.nl).},

Menyanthes was initially developed within the scope of the PhD research of the first author, whose primary aim was the integration of data and physically-based methods for modeling time series of groundwater heads. As such, time series analysis forms the heart of Menyanthes. Within Menyanthes, time series can be modeled using both the ARMA and PIRFICT methods. The PIRFICT method is a new method of time series analysis that has practical advantages and facilitates physical interpretation and implementation of knowledge on physical behavior. Analytic solutions to specific hydrogeologic problems may be used as response function, along with their physically-based parameters. A more general approach is possible using Skew-Gaussian distribution functions, which prove to fit the behavior of hydrogeologic (and other) systems well. Use of such functions within the PIRFICT method substantially simplifies the model identification procedure, as compared to the traditional Box-Jenkins procedure. PIRFICT models may be fitted to a large number of time series in batch. Spatial patterns that emerge in the results provide useful, additional, and independent information, which adds another dimension to time series analysis. Their interpretation is supported by the spatial visualization and analysis tools of Menyanthes. The PIRFICT method also facilitates the integration of time series and spatially-distributed models via, e.g., moment-generating differential equations. The PIRFICT method may prove to be of use for other types of time series as well, both within and outside the realm of environmental sciences.},

	abstract = {Groundwater, water in the ground. Although it is invisible, it is a vital resource for all terrestrial life (whether direct or indirect). Many processes interact with it. Rain recharges it, as it infiltrates the soil. Plant roots take it up, and their leaves evaporate it. It discharges to rivers and streams, and is abstracted with pumping wells. It is controlled with ditches and drainage means. Such processes and activities leave their traces in the groundwater level fluctuations. Careful analysis of these fluctuations may reveal much of the functioning of systems, and of the effects of individual factors. This is shown by many, but practiced by too few, as traditional time series analysis theory and software are complex.

In this thesis, a new method of time series analysis is presented. Its continuous time formulation fits existing physical-hydrologic theory and methods well. It is shown that groundwater level responses generally take the shape of simple distribution functions. This notion, combined with the program Menyanthes that was developed, enable the quick and easy analysis of large numbers of time series. The spatial patterns that emerge in the results of multiple models literally add another dimension to the technique. As time series models are usually accurate also, they may be valuable to every (eco)hydrologist.},

	abstract = {Most of the existing generation of general circulation models (GCMs) use so-called bucket algorithms to represent land-surface hydrology. Biosphere-atmosphere models that include the transfer of energy, mass, and momentum between the atmosphere and the land surface are a recent alternative to this highly simplified representation of the land surface in GCMs. These models require estimation of a large number of parameters for which parameter estimation methods and supporting data remain to be developed. We describe a more incremental approach to generalizing the bucket representation of land-surface hydrology based on a model that represents the variation in infiltration capacity within a GCM grid cell. The variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model requires estimation of three parameters: an infiltration parameter, an evaporation parameter, and a base flow recession coefficient. The VIC model was explored through direct comparisons with the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) bucket model for the French Broad River, North Carolina, and via sensitivity analysis for the GFDL R30 grid cell which contains the French Broad River. Generally, the bucket model runoff had much greater variability than the historic streamflows for short time scales (e.g., 1 day); the VIC model was much more similar to the observed flows in this respect. The results also showed that the bucket model tended to have unrealistically high short-term variability. The sensitivity analysis showed that the base flow parameter exerted the greatest influence on both the mean and variability of most of the hydrologic variables, especially winter runoff, summer evaporation, and summer and winter soil moisture.},

	abstract = {Time series data on precipitation rates and groundwater heads are used for transfer function-noise (TFN) models which are employed to analyse and predict fluctuations in groundwater levels around a hilly site hosting underground gas storage caverns. The time series of groundwater heads, however, has been collected at irregular intervals and, in some cases, it has missing values at various points. It is necessary to use a method of times series analysis that is capable of filling in these observational gaps. For the irregularly observed time series, Kalman filtering is applied. To apply the Kalman filter, the TFN models must first be written as a state space in vector notation. Then the Kalman filter is combined with a maximum likelihood criterion to estimate the parameters of the TFN model. The Kalman filtering equation is iteratively calculated using appropriate initial parameters. The filtering procedure incorporates the recursive ‘prediction–correction’ form using a maximum likelihood criterion. After validating TFN models estimated using recursive filtering, these models are used to forecast and predict the values at non-observed time steps. The comparison between the predicted heads and the observed heads in the validation period show reasonably good matches.},
