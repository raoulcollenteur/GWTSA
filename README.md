# GWTSA - Groundwater Time Series Analysis

GroundwaTSA stands for Groundwater Time Series Analysis. This computer program can be used to simulate groundwater time series explained multiple inputs. It is for the biggest part written in Python, with some of the more computationally more demanding parts in the C-programming language.

GroundWaTSA strives to provide the user with full control over the the simulation. The program is object oriented and allows for additional explanatory series to be added. In addition to other time series modelling software it allows you to deal with non-linear time series through the application of a unsaturated zone model.
