*21/02/2017*: After finishing my thesis work, colleagues from the TU Delft and Artesia Water and I started working on Pastas, an Open Source hydrological time series package written in Python. This reposiory is only kept alive as it is referenced to in my thesis. Please have a look at: https://github.com/pastas/pastas

# GWTSA - Groundwater Time Series Analysis

GWTSA stands for Groundwater Time Series Analysis. This computer program can be used to simulate groundwater time series explained multiple inputs. It is for the biggest part written in Python, with some of the more computationally more demanding parts in the C-programming language.

GroundWaTSA strives to provide the user with full control over the the simulation. The program is object oriented and allows for additional explanatory series to be added. In addition to other time series modelling software it allows you to deal with non-linear time series through the application of a unsaturated zone model.
